# Documentation

## React Router

Currently used to routes URL paths. Eventual move to Next.js is an option.

## styled-components

Used for base-layer CSS

## Hardhat

Used for testing Ethereum smart contracts

## The Graph

Not used yet, but might be useful for indexing some of the CentralDex functions, like getting all available exchanges. We'll not want to call this directly from the contract each time, but will want to refresh at least daily. I think The Graph helps with this.

## Ethers Project

Client-side library for interacting with smart contracts. Purposefully chosen over web3.

## React Hook Forms
